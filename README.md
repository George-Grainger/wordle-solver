# wordle-solver

A Wordle solver made using information theory, based on the [video by Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doFowk4xj7Q).

This acts as a submodule for a Wordle extension I created, which is freely available on the[Chrome store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wordle-assistant/djofdcdjkjlpbacneapdehcaandgemoe).
